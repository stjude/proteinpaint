SNV/SNP or point mutations nucleotide mutations are very common forms of mutations which can often give rise to genetic diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer's disease etc. They can be duw to substitution of nucleotide, or insertion or deletion of a nucleotide. Indels are multi-nucleotide insertion/deletion/substitutions. Complex indels are indels where insertion and deletion have happened in the same genomic locus. Every genomic sample from each patient has its own set of mutations therefore requiring personalized treatment. 

If a ProteinPaint dataset contains SNV/Indel/SV data then return JSON with single key, 'snv_indel'.

Copy number variation (CNV) is a phenomenon in which sections of the genome are repeated and the number of repeats in the genome varies between individuals.[1] Copy number variation is a special type of structural variation: specifically, it is a type of duplication or deletion event that affects a considerable number of base pairs.

If a ProteinPaint dataset contains copy number variation data then return JSON with single key, 'cnv'.

Structural variants/fusions (SV) are genomic mutations when eith a DNA region is translocated or copied to an entirely different genomic locus. In case of transcriptomic data, when RNA is fused from two different genes its called a gene fusion.

If a ProteinPaint dataset contains structural variation or gene fusion data then return JSON with single key, 'sv_fusion'.

Hierarchial clustering of gene expression is an unsupervised learning technique where several number of relevant genes and the samples are clustered so as to determine (previously unknown) cohorts of samples (or patients) or structure in data. It is very commonly used to determine subtypes of a particular disease based on RNA sequencing data. 

If a ProteinPaint dataset contains hierarchial data then return JSON with single key, 'hierarchial'.

Differential Gene Expression (DGE or DE) is a technique where the most upregulated and downregulated genes between two cohorts of samples (or patients) are determined. A volcano plot is shown with fold-change in the x-axis and adjusted p-value on the y-axis. So, the upregulated and downregulared genes are on opposite sides of the graph and the most significant genes (based on adjusted p-value) is on the top of the graph. Following differential gene expression generally GeneSet Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) is carried out where based on the genes and their corresponding fold changes the upregulation/downregulation of genesets (or pathways) is determined.

If a ProteinPaint dataset contains differential gene expression data then return JSON with single key, 'dge'.

Survival analysis (also called time-to-event analysis or duration analysis) is a branch of statistics aimed at analyzing the duration of time from a well-defined time origin until one or more events happen, called survival times or duration times. In other words, in survival analysis, we are interested in a certain event and want to analyze the time until the event happens.

There are two main methods of survival analysis:

1) Kaplan-Meier (HM) analysis is a univariate test that only takes into account a single categorical variable.
2) Cox proportional hazards model (coxph) is a multivariate test that can take into account multiple variables.

   The hazard ratio (HR) is an indicator of the effect of the stimulus (e.g. drug dose, treatment) between two cohorts of patients.
   HR = 1: No effect
   HR < 1: Reduction in the hazard
   HR > 1: Increase in Hazard

If a ProteinPaint dataset contains survival data then return JSON with single key, 'survival'.

Next generation sequencing reads (NGS) are mapped to a human genome using alignment algorithm such as burrows-wheelers alignment algorithm. Then these reads are called using variant calling algorithms such as GATK (Genome Analysis Toolkit). However this type of analysis is too compute intensive and beyond the scope of visualization software such as ProteinPaint.

If a user query asks about variant calling or mapping reads then JSON with single key, 'variant_calling'.

Summary plot in ProteinPaint shows the various facets of the datasets. It may show all the samples according to their respective diagnosis or subtypes of cancer. It is also useful for visualizing all the different facets of the dataset. You can display a categorical variable and overlay another variable on top it and stratify (or divide) using a third variable simultaneously. You can also custom filters to the dataset so that you can only study part of the dataset. If a user query asks about variant calling or mapping reads then JSON with single key, 'summary'.

Sample Query1: "Show all fusions for patients with age less than 30"
Sample Answer1: { \"answer\": \"summary\" }

Sample Query1: "List all molecular subtypes of leukemia"
Sample Answer1: { \"answer\": \"summary\" }

If a query does not match any of the fields described above, then return JSON with single key, 'none'
