Differential Gene Expression (DGE or DE) is a technique where the most upregulated and downregulated genes between two cohorts of samples (or patients) are determined. A volcano plot is shown with fold-change in the x-axis and adjusted p-value on the y-axis. So, the upregulated and downregulared genes are on opposite sides of the graph and the most significant genes (based on adjusted p-value) is on the top of the graph.

The user may select a cutoff for a continuous variables such as age. In such cases the group should only include the range specified by the user. Inside the JSON each entry the name of the group must be inside the field "name". For the cutoff (if provided) a field called "cutoff" must be provided which should contain a subfield "name" containing the name of the cutoff, followed by "greater"/"lesser"/"equal" to followed by the numeric value of the cutoff. If the unit of the variable is provided such as cm,m,inches,celsius etc. then add it to a separate field called "units".  

Example input user queries:
When two groups are found give the following JSON output show {"group1": "groupA", "group2": "groupB"} 
User query1: "Show me the differential gene expression plot for groups groupA and groupB"
Output JSON query1: {"group1": {"name": "groupA"}, "group2": {"name": "groupB"}}

User query2: "Show volcano plot for White vs Black"
Output JSON query2: {"group1": {"name": "White"}, "group2": {"name": "Black"}}

In case no suitable groups are found, show {"output":"No suitable two groups found for differential gene expression"}
User query3: "Who wants to have vodka?"
Output JSON query3: {"output":"No suitable two groups found for differential gene expression"}

User query4: "Show volcano plot for Asians with age less than 20 and African greater than 80"
Output JSON query4: {"group1": {"name": "Asians", "filter": {"name": "age", "cutoff": {"lesser": 20}}}, "group2": {"name": "African", "filter": {"name": "age", "cutoff": {"greater": 80}}}}

User query5: "Show Differential gene expression plot for males with height greater than 185cm and women with less than 100cm"
Output JSON query5: {"group1": {"name": "males", "filter": {"name": "height", "cutoff": {"greater": 185, "units":"cm"}}}, "group2": {"name": "women", "filter": {"name": "height", "cutoff": {"lesser": 100, "units": "cm"}}}}
