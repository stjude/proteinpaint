## Background

Only include type definitions used in the client workspace here. 
These types should be specific to the client workspace and not shared with
any other workspace (e.g. server, shared, etc.). 

Types specific to a single subdirectory within client should be saved in that subdirectory.

## Develop

When importing types, use the `import type ..` syntax. An import path has not been 
assigned to this directory. Use the appropriate, relative path.
