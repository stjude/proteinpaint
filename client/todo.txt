# TODOs

## Before merging to master
- reenable test/internals.js
- use proteinpaint.js instead of front.app.js as script src in index.html
- update package-lock.json

## Post-esbuild migration
- remove webpack-related dependencies everywhere: may create a new workspace for tests, node polyfill deps for tape and esbuild
- remove nodemon from pp and sjpp scripts, dependencies: why was this retained, maybe for pm2?
- clean up front and server deps: nodemon, node-watch, etc
