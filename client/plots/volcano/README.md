# Volcano plot
The volcano plot is intended to be a reusable component. It was developed as a child component
of the differential analysis app which requires a termType in the config. Term types must be 
added to the volcano as of this writing. 

## Add a term type
Ensure the following are completed. This is not a comprehensive list. Modify as needed.
- Add control inputs in VolcanoControlsInputs.ts
- Add logic to the view model for the term type. 
- Add rows for the tooltip in the view
