# Differential Analysis App
The app is designed to launch plots as components. To share data between components, use DiffAnalysisInteractions.

The differential analysis plot is heavily dependent on the volcano plot data. However the volcano plot can be launched independently. 

## Adding a component
- Add the import statement for the plot
- Include the tab with callback for the config in DiffAnalysis View.
