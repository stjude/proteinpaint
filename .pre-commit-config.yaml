  # for Proteinpaint, the team preference is for the prettier formatting
  # to be applied as part of the commit, not as a separate commit
  # prior to the code change commit. The bash entry below does this, but
  # seems to trigger CI errors if included in this config, so we will 
  # trigger prettier separately from this yaml

        # ideally, a separate commit for code formatting, but much simpler 
        # to trigger formatting and re-staging as part of commit
