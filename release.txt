Features:
- For hg38-based datasets, Disco plot allows to prioritize gene labels by Cancer Gene Census genes.
- Numeric termsetting edit UI shows density curve at mode=continuous.
- Update gene filter to restrict filtering for multiple alteration groups.
- Unify click behavior for survival and cuminc legend items.
- Mds3 numeric axis (e.g. occurrence) y scale can be edited.
- PrOFILE polar and barchart bug fixes and improvements.
- Implemented at-risk count filter in mass cuminc plot
- GDC "Age at diagnosis" value by day is shown as "X years, Y days" in mds3 sample table.
- Prototype a hierarchical cluster plot using the matrix plot

Fixes:
- Ignore hidden values when conducting association tests for mass barchart.
- Do not force a matrix barplot min scale to 0;
- Fix the missing tooltip when mousing over second+ continuous matrix barplot rows
- For matrix plot, when "Group Samples By" a variable that has predefined order, use that order for subgroups. 
- For SSM from GDC API, use consequence from canonical transcript designated by GDC.
- GDC SSM range query by graphql appropriately accounts for sample filtering from a subtk.
- In GDC bam slicing block display, clicking on a transcript from native gene tk will disable the "View in protein" option.
- Hierarchical clustering R script is improve to include scaling step.
