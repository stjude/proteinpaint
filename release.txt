Fixes:
- supply the missing api reference when launching a gdc matrix
- Option to override the matrix default of not rendering samples that are not annotated for any dictionary term, for more intuitive behavior in gene-centric use-cases
- Matrix should update when the filter0 changes while the geneset edit UI is displayed
