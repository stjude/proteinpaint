Fixes:
- Cancel stale fetch requests to unblock current geneset, matrix, and hierCluster requests that are being throttled by the browser's concurrent request limit
- Do not re-render the matrix controls as part of displaying a no data message when svg dimensions and layout have not been computed yet
- Do not assign a non-auth related error as a token verification message, which caused the matrix to not rerender even with subsequent valid data
- Do not display a mouseover over a hidden matrix or hier cluster svg
