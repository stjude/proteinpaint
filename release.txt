Fixes:
- prevent the submission of plot edits while input variable data is still being loaded
- downgrade missing plot config into a warning, instead of displaying an irrelevant error message
- remove add-to-filter option from correlation plot selection of rendered data; fix the returned GDC API  bins from getData()
