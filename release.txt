Features
- On the SC plot sample info now shows on every plot at the top after the tab controls. Used yellow color as starting color in the color scale and
 increased the default sample size to improve the visualization. Contours only enabled when overlaying a gene to avoid the confusion with the
 cluster contours that do not use color info. Adjusted contour bandwidth after reducing default plot size.
