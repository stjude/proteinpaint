Enhancements
- Display sample counts in matrix sample group labels, mouseovers, and legend.

Fixes
- Process commit-based release notes on commit instead of in CI; revert changelog generator.
- Cohort creation in the matrix plot, where sample atttribute mapping is required.
- Allow continuous variables to be added to GDC matrix without breaking. Next will support query of graphql API to retrieve min/max of the variables.
- Sort matrix samples by gene variant hits before grouping, then sort again within each group
