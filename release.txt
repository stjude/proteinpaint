Features
- Profile plots have now filters and a download button
- Make disco plot rings width configurable
- Added to scatter plot scale dot option
- Support a reset button option for the rx recover component

Fixes:
- Selecting hundreds of samples from GDC lollipop no longer hangs or crashes (using a cached mapping to case uuid)
- Fix the numeric edit menu when violin plot data is requested for a GDC variable, which needs currentGeneNames
- Bug fix to show reduced sample summaries when creating sub-track from GDC lollipop (mds3) track
- Correctly handle special uncomputable numeric term values in a matrix row bar plot, when mode='continuous' 
- GDC OncoMatrix has switched to use case uuid but not case submitter id to align data, while still displaying submitter ids on UI; the latter is not unique between projects.
