Fixes:
- Selecting hundreds of samples from GDC lollipop no longer hangs or crashes (using a cached mapping to case uuid)
- Fix the numeric edit menu when violin plot data is requested for a GDC variable, which needs currentGeneNames
- Bug fix to show reduced sample summaries when creating sub-track from GDC lollipop (mds3) track
